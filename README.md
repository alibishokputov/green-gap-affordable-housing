Spatial analysis of the **green gap** in affordable housing across Washington, DC and
Maryland — how green space (from land cover / land use rasters) relates to the location
of affordable housing (LIHTC and NHPD).

## Stack

- **Environment:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python 3.12)
- **Vector geospatial:** geopandas, shapely, pyogrio, pyproj, mapclassify, libpysal, esda
- **Raster / satellite:** rasterio, rioxarray, xarray, dask, rasterstats, geocube
- **Basemaps:** contextily
- **Static viz:** matplotlib, **plotnine** (grammar of graphics)
- **Interactive maps:** folium, plotly, leafmap (+ a **bivariate choropleth** helper)
- **Notebooks → public site:** Jupyter + **Quarto**, published to **GitHub Pages** via GitHub Actions

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install the environment (creates .venv, resolves & locks everything)
uv sync

# 2. Register / launch Jupyter Lab
uv run jupyter lab

# 3. Preview the public site locally (renders notebooks with live maps)
uv run quarto preview

# 4. Run tests & lint
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check
```

## Publishing the notebooks (public site)

Notebooks in `notebooks/` are rendered by Quarto into a static website and published to
GitHub Pages automatically on every push to `main` (see `.github/workflows/publish.yml`).

**One-time setup on GitHub:** repo *Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source =
GitHub Actions*. After the first successful run the site is live at
`https://<user>.github.io/green-gap-affordable-housing/`.

Executed notebook outputs are cached in `_freeze/` (committed) via Quarto's
`freeze: auto`, so CI does not re-run heavy geospatial code unless a notebook changes.
When you edit a notebook, run `uv run quarto render` locally once to refresh the freeze,
then commit the updated `_freeze/`.

## Bivariate maps

`greengap/bivariate.py` provides a small toolkit for **bivariate choropleths** (encoding
two variables at once on a 3×3 color grid) that works with folium, geopandas `.explore`,
matplotlib, or plotly. See `notebooks/1.0-example-green-gap-demo.ipynb` for a worked
example crossing *green-space share* × *affordable-housing units*.

## Green-gap dashboard (Shiny)

An interactive **tree canopy % × LIHTC affordable units** bivariate map at census-tract
level for **Maryland + Washington, DC** (1,666 mapped tracts).

**Published (no server, no install):** `https://<user>.github.io/green-gap-affordable-housing/dashboard/`

Run it locally:

```bash
uv run python -m greengap.dataset build   # one-time: builds the analysis table (~20 min)
uv run shiny run app/app.py               # then open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### How it's published

`scripts/build_shinylive.py` compiles the app to **WebAssembly** (shinylive), so it runs
entirely in the reader's browser and is served as static files from GitHub Pages — no server,
no runtime limits, nothing to keep awake. The Pages workflow builds it into `_site/dashboard`
on every push to `main`.

```bash
# rebuild the dashboard's data after re-running the pipeline, then commit it
uv run python scripts/build_shinylive.py --refresh-data --out _site/dashboard
python3 -m http.server --directory _site/dashboard 8000   # preview the static build
```

`app/tracts.geojson` (1.9 MB) is **committed on purpose** — it is the hand-off between the local
pipeline and the published site, because CI cannot rebuild it (that needs the 2.4 GB rasters and
a ~20-minute extraction). Regenerate it with `--refresh-data` whenever the analysis table
changes, and commit the result.

> ### Pyodide constraints — read before editing `app/app.py`
>
> The app runs in the browser, which rules out things that work fine locally. These are not
> style preferences; each one was a blank page:
>
> - **No `matplotlib`.** Importing it starts a font-cache build that never completes (measured
>   >330 s with no first paint). Every chart is HTML/CSS or inline SVG instead.
> - **No `mapclassify`** — it imports matplotlib at module scope, so it triggers the same hang.
>   `greengap/classify.py` reimplements the three schemes with numpy only, and
>   `tests/test_classify.py` pins it to mapclassify's results so the published map and the local
>   map cannot diverge.
> - **No `pyarrow`** → no `read_parquet` in the browser. The app reads bundled GeoJSON via
>   `GeoDataFrame.from_features` (shapely only, no GDAL).
> - **No `greengap.config`** — it pulls in `dotenv`/`loguru`.
> - **No `union_all()`** on the tract geometries: GEOS raises a TopologyException on
>   simplification artefacts, which *hard-crashes* the WASM runtime rather than raising.
> - Declare **every transitive dependency** in the build script's `REQUIREMENTS`; shinylive
>   resolves none of them (folium alone needs branca, jinja2, xyzservices and requests).
>
> The build script asserts the no-matplotlib invariant and fails loudly if it is ever broken.
> First paint is currently ~11 s; re-measure it if you add a dependency.

The dashboard has a bivariate map, a joint-distribution heatmap, a scatter with an OLS fit,
and a filtered table of **green-gap tracts** (high LIHTC / low canopy — the argument of the
study). Controls: county filter, canopy definition, LIHTC measure, classification scheme,
palette, and whether breaks are computed on the visible selection or the whole state.

### The data pipeline

`greengap/dataset.py` builds the analysis table in cached steps:

| Step | What | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| `tracts` | TIGER census tracts + county names (MD + DC) | `data/interim/tracts.parquet` |
| `lihtc` | LIHTC points → summed to tracts | `data/interim/lihtc_by_tract.parquet` |
| `canopy` | 1 m Chesapeake land cover → per-tract class fractions (`exactextract`) | `data/interim/canopy_by_tract_{24,11}.parquet` |
| `build` | join of the above | `data/processed/tract_canopy_lihtc.parquet` |

Run any step alone (`uv run python -m greengap.dataset canopy --state 11`). The MD raster is
2.4 GB at 1 m, so `canopy` is the slow step (~20 min for MD; DC takes 8 s) — it caches
per-state so you only pay once, and `build --force` deliberately will **not** re-trigger it
(use `--force-upstream` for that). Pass `--raster /path/to/extracted.tif` to skip reading
inside the zip.

**Four things worth knowing about the data:**

- **Use the national LIHTC file, not `LIHTC.csv`.** The bundled CSV is a Maryland-only extract
  (948 MD rows, **zero DC**). The pipeline instead reads HUD's national database from
  `data/raw/lihtc.zip` (`LIHTCPUB.xlsx`), which has MD 948 + **DC 268**. `openpyxl` cannot
  parse it (HUD emits a `synchVertical` attribute it rejects), hence the `calamine` engine.
- **Use HUD's imputed unit columns.** Raw `li_units` has 27 nulls, which `sum()` skips
  silently — a ~2,200-unit undercount. The pipeline uses `li_unitr`/`n_unitsr` (0 nulls), as
  HUD's data dictionary instructs.
- **Canopy definition matters.** The Chesapeake land cover splits canopy across four classes
  (3 = Tree Canopy; 10/11/12 = canopy over structures / other impervious / roads). The default
  `canopy_pct` counts all four (standard urban-tree-canopy practice) and divides by
  **classified land area** (water *and* nodata excluded). Counting only class 3 undercounts
  canopy by up to ~3× in dense urban tracts — exactly where LIHTC concentrates. Both
  definitions are in the app so you can test sensitivity.
- **15 tracts have no measurable canopy** and are excluded: open-water tracts (Census `99xxxx`
  series) and military land, which the Chesapeake raster leaves as nodata (Aberdeen Proving
  Ground, Joint Base Andrews). They are flagged by `canopy_reliable`. Validation: area-weighted
  canopy comes to 34.9% for DC (published UTC ≈ 38%, and our land cover is the 2017 edition)
  and 49.8% for MD.

> **Classification gotcha:** ~70% of tracts have zero LIHTC. Quantile breaks therefore put both
> cut points at 0, collapsing the LIHTC axis to two classes and **emptying the high-LIHTC
> corner the study is about** (statewide: 22 green-gap tracts under natural breaks vs **0**
> under quantiles). Natural breaks is the default; the app warns if quantiles degenerate.
